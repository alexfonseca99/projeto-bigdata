# projeto-bigdata

Big Data Processing course project

The goal is to cluster different types of frames (drone images, close-up images, motorcycle images, ad breaks, etc.) on a Giro d'Italia video, using unsupervised learning algorithms. Frames are represented as an image embedding (generated by a CNN), as well as a skeleton set generated by [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose)

Used concepts include:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to get insight on some characteristics of the data
2. Using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, and outlier detection methods like RANSAC
3. Data clustering methods like Agglomerative Clustering
4. Final result and data visualization
